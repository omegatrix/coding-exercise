## Requirements

This project uses [Django](https://github.com/django/django) web framework `4.0.3` which requires Python `3.8` or above.

Download and install Python if you have not got it installed already. Guides can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). From this point forward it is assumed that you have got Python `3.8` or above installed.

## Installation

Clone the repository if you have not already done it. Next, navigate to the folder by using command:

```
cd {path-to-the-folder}/coding-exercise
```

Create a virtual environment
> **_More about virtual environments:_**  [Virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

(Optional) Upgrade `pip` if needed
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the required dependencies:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to run the application locally.


## Running the app

Run the following command on your terminal

```
python manage.py runserver
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Django might not be happy about runnig the app without the initial migration. You can ignore the warning message as this is okay since we will not be using a database nor utilise admin functionalitites.

The application runs on `localhost` and port `8000` which is `127.0.0.1:8000`

You can use an API development tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to access the API endpoints. Alternatively, you can use [Curl](https://curl.se/) commands.
